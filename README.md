# JPMorgan-Chase-SWE-Virtual-Internship

This project develops a web application as part of the JPMorgan Chase's [Software Engineering Virtual Internship](https://careers.jpmorgan.com/US/en/students/campaign/virtual-internship). In particular, the web application provides an interactive dashboard that tracks and visualizes daily movements of stock data in a clear and visually appealing manner and alert potential trading opportunities. Hence, this visualization of stock data feeds allows users to monitor potential trade strategies.

<b>Aim:</b> Use Perspective to generate a chart that displays the data feed in a clear and visually appealing manner for traders to monitor this trading strategy. Basically, you have to modify the existing live chart to be able to (1) track and display the ratio between the two stock prices (2) show the historical upper and lower bounds of the stocks' ratio (3) and finally, show 'alerts'  whenever these bounds are crossed by the ratio.
